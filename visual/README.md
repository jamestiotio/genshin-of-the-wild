# Visual Screenshots Comparison Research

Use the `ImagePlot` macro for `ImageJ` to compare the screenshot dataset.

You might need to install Java-related dependencies (such as JDK or/and JRE) to be able to run ImageJ.

While I have included ImagePlot in this folder, make sure to download the latest version of ImagePlot from [here](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html) or [here](https://github.com/culturevis/imageplot) and ImageJ from [here](https://imagej.net/Downloads) or [here](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html), since ImagePlot requires ImageJ to run properly (ImagePlot is just an ImageJ macro).
